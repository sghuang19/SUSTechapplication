# Frontmatter Specs

In `v2` of SUSTech Application, flat directory structure and YAML frontmatter
are used to help users navigate the posts they're interested in. The specs for
the frontmatter is documented here.

Here's a boilerplate of YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
title: "Tender, Strong, and True"
pubDate: "2023-03-01"
year: 19
region: us
category: grad
university: nd
degree: ms
major: sme
program: cse
```

A detailed lookup table can be found in `frontmatter.yaml`. Most of the fields
are self-explanatory. The only caveat is, `major` is for major at SUSTech, and
`program` is for the program applied to.
